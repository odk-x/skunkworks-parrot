Whereas members of ODK Groups are added by default.
It is part of Open Data Kit (ODK), a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. Learn more about the Open Data Kit project and its history [here](https://opendatakit.org/about/) and read about example ODK deployments [here](https://opendatakit.org/about/deployments/).


## Setting up your development environment

1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and add it to your PATH

1. Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) 

1. Fork the collect project ([why and how to fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))

        git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/opendatakit/skunkworks-parrot

 If you prefer not to use the command line, you can use IntelliJ IDEA to create a new project from version control using `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/opendatakit/skunkworks-parrot`. 

1. Open the project in the folder of your clone from IntelliJ IDEA ide.

2. To run the project, click on the green arrow at the top of the screen. This project uses the Java library,called JavaFX,which is used to develop a desktop application as well as Rich Internet Applications(RIA).This library supports the .fxml files. But JavaFX is not supported in the latest Java version, but is supported in versions like Java 8,Java 9 and Java 10.For java 11, the library package have to be installed separately. This can be done using the link given below: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
3. Click on the configure option after you run the app for the first time.

4. Create a Firebase project and add necessary data to sync the app with firebase. Step by step instructions for creating a Firebase project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10_9oU_8zrek7lt7BRYmJJwo22rs51uAw).

###### To build an executable JAR using Gradle
  1. Build executable JAR by
```bash
            ./gradlew build (for Linux)
            gradlew.bat build (for Windows)
```
  2. A JAR will be built inside build/libs/, you can run the JAR by
```bash
           java -jar name_of_jar.jar
```

## Prerequisites

[ODK Sync Endpoint](https://docs.opendatakit.org/odk2/sync-endpoint/) server is needed for the application to run. Once the server is up, enter the url in configure section of the app. Users with 'SITE_ACCESS_ADMIN' role can only access the application.
